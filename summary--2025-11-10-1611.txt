The VTuber mentions having seen videos of people making jam, noting how much sugar is typically added, almost like pieces of sugar. She then discusses how honey doesn't harden. She seems to be learning that adding sugar to milk makes condensed milk, and removing sugar makes evaporated milk, which she describes as having a rich milk taste. The VTuber has never made jam herself and thinks it looks difficult but wants to try. She expresses her fondness for chunky jam, where the fruit, like strawberries, still retains some of its original shape for a nice texture. She adds that a friend makes this kind of delicious chunky jam. After talking about this, she sneezes.

The cute white and purple character is a bit fidgety, making soft humming sounds and occasionally yawning. It mentions feeling fine but then oddly says it is drinking water because it is cold. The character then excitedly talks about food, sharing that it had soba and gyoza for dinner last night. It expresses a great love for frozen gyoza that can be easily heated in the microwave. Specifically, it praises Lawson's gyoza, noting that it has a strong garlic flavor that is not too intense, and finds the ginger flavor to be absolutely the best. The character now really wants to eat gyoza again.
