The player successfully completes the "Energy Collection" quest after gathering the required spatial crystals, vodka, and car batteries, earning experience and gold. A new quest then appears, instructing the player to install an energy system. The player locates the yellow van-like spaceship and installs the energy system as directed. A "Launch (Ending 0)" option immediately becomes available, prompting the player to wonder about the meaning of "Ending 0" and if it implies multiple outcomes. Feeling apprehensive, the player empties their inventory, storing all their weapons and items, noting how simple their character now looks. The player then returns to the spaceship, commenting on the escape from the bunker and the "J-Lab crew" they are leaving behind. With the launch initiated, a cinematic plays showing the spaceship's engines igniting and the vehicle lifting off, which the player finds amazing and solid.

The stream opens with an exciting display of a yellow van, featuring a prominent rubber duck on its roof, being outfitted with propulsion devices, leading to the streamer's enthusiastic "Launch!" The vehicle then lifts off, soaring over a vast, forested landscape that conceals a hidden base, prompting the streamer to ponder its maneuverability. A quick zoom-in confirms the little rubber duck is still aboard the now-flying van, a detail the streamer playfully notes she was unaware of. As the vehicle continues its flight, leaving a bright trail across the sky, the streamer encourages its journey, briefly observing a distant red object on the ground, speculating it might be a meteor. Abruptly, the screen fades to black, presenting text that reveals the streamer's character was left behind due to insufficient space on the spaceship, concluding with "The End." This unexpected turn of events leaves the streamer comically bewildered, questioning why she was abandoned and jokingly vowing to build her own spaceship. As the game credits roll for "Escape From Duckov," acknowledging various production roles, the streamer maintains a lighthearted, sarcastic tone, pretending to scold the developers for the surprising conclusion and expressing disbelief that the game ended so soon, expecting more missions and areas to explore before finally thanking everyone for playing.

The stream begins with a black screen displaying "THE END" in both English and Japanese characters, then transitions to a loading screen. The game, titled "Escape From Dukkos," then loads into an isometric view of a base. The streamer navigates her character, a small pink figure, around the map, exploring different rooms and areas. She comments on what seems like a previous event where she was "attacked by a cannon" according to her memory, noting that something seems odd. She checks the quest log, where she sees a quest to "Set up the energy system" which is already complete. She continues to move around the base, observing a "pink area" on the left side that looks ominous and inaccessible without a card key. She deduces that she needs to activate a beacon somewhere to proceed to the "J-Lab" area, which currently shows a "beacon not activated" message and a requirement of 2,000 currency. She moves further into the base, noting a cannon-like device she supposedly fired, and wonders who might have shot it, expressing surprise at the timing and even pondering a "black curtain theory." She then revisits the quest log, finding a new quest.

The streamer begins by examining the quest titled "An Eye for an Eye," reading its description about overcoming past bullying and demonstrating strength using specific weapons. The objectives require eliminating different enemy types such as Chigamo, Speed Squad Leader, Shot Gunner, Vida, Triple S Squad, and Explosion Mania, each with a designated weapon like the AK-47, MP7, TOZ-66 Dragon Press, RPK, M1A, and UP-45. She lightheartedly comments on the "rough" nature of the quest description and remarks on the "Super" item shown as a reward. After accepting the quest, she navigates through the other ongoing missions, which include high score challenges like "Snake Force," "Duck Miner," and "Soda Crisis," along with "Fishing Master" and "Gold Sniper." She then humorously laments about being left behind in a "bad ending" after being utilized, jokingly asking why she was abandoned and finding it unfair that there wasn't a seat for her. Following this, the stream shifts back to gameplay in a bunker setting, where she moves her character around the facility, observing the environment and seemingly searching for something or someone, reiterating her previous comment about finding someone who wants to remain in the bunker.
