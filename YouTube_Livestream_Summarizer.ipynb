    "## 🔧 FFmpeg Stability Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes several optimizations to prevent FFmpeg crashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffer Overflow Prevention\n",
    "- **Output draining**: FFmpeg stderr is captured and drained to prevent buffer buildup\n",
    "- **Reduced logging**: Uses `-loglevel error` to minimize output\n",
    "- **Background threads**: Output is handled asynchronously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Stability\n",
    "- **Reconnection flags**: Automatic HLS stream reconnection\n",
    "  - `-reconnect 1`: Enable reconnection\n",
    "  - `-reconnect_streamed 1`: Reconnect to HLS streams\n",
    "  - `-reconnect_delay_max 10`: Max 10s delay between reconnects\n",
    "  - `-timeout 30000000`: 30 second timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Management\n",
    "- **Automatic cleanup**: Old segments are deleted automatically\n",
    "- **Memory-efficient**: Only keeps necessary segments in memory\n",
    "- **GPU encoding**: Uses NVENC for fast, low-CPU encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring\n",
    "- **Process health checks**: Detects if FFmpeg exits unexpectedly\n",
    "- **Segment size tracking**: Monitors recording progress\n",
    "- **Error diagnostics**: Shows detailed error messages when issues occur\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Custom Prompt Examples\n",

    "## ⚠️ Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU Required**: T4 GPU is REQUIRED for proper operation. CPU encoding is too slow for livestreams.\n",
    "- **Session Limits**: Google Colab free tier has ~12 hour session limits. Pro/Pro+ have longer limits.\n",
    "- **HLS URL Expiration**: YouTube HLS URLs expire after a few minutes. The app will detect this and show a clear error message.\n",
    "- **API Limits**: Free Gemini API has rate limits. Consider upgrading for heavy usage.\n",
    "- **Network**: Stable internet connection required for streaming.\n",
    "- **Storage**: Segments are cleaned automatically to save disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Behavior\n",
    "- **First cycle**: Takes ~2-5 minutes (needs 4 segments @ 30s each)\n",
    "- **Subsequent cycles**: Every 2 minutes (4 new segments)\n",
    "- **FFmpeg runs continuously**: Recording never stops between cycles\n",
    "- **Summaries in background**: Processing happens while recording continues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Warnings (Normal)\n",
    "- ⚠️ \"segment_XXX.mp4 not started yet\" - Normal wait between cycles\n",
    "- 🔄 \"Finalizing: segment_XXX.mp4\" - Last segment completing\n",
    "- 📊 \"Cycle #X: Starting...\" - New cycle beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### FFmpeg Exits After 2-3 Minutes (Exit Code 0)\n",
    "- **Cause**: YouTube HLS URL expired (URLs expire after a few minutes)\n",
    "- **Solution**: This is expected behavior. The app will show detailed diagnostics.\n",
    "- **Current Status**: Automatic HLS URL refresh is not yet implemented.\n",
    "- **Workaround**: \n",
    "  1. Use shorter video durations (60-90s instead of 120s)\n",
    "  2. Restart manually every ~2 minutes\n",
    "  3. Wait for automatic refresh feature (coming soon)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"No GPU detected\" or very slow recording\n",
    "- **Solution**: Enable T4 GPU runtime\n",
    "- Go to Runtime → Change runtime type → Set to T4 GPU\n",
    "- Restart the runtime and run all cells again\n",
    "- **Note**: CPU encoding is too slow for real-time livestreams\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Failed to extract HLS URL\"\n",
    "- Make sure the YouTube URL is correct\n",
    "- Ensure the stream is live or available\n",
    "- Try updating yt-dlp: `!pip install -U yt-dlp`\n",
    "- Check if the stream requires authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Gemini API Error\"\n",
    "- Check that your API key is valid\n",
    "- Verify you haven't exceeded rate limits\n",
    "- Try a shorter video duration\n",
    "- Wait a few minutes and try again\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segments Stuck at Same Size\n",
    "- Check FFmpeg output (shown in progress log when FFmpeg exits)\n",
    "- Verify stream is still live\n",
    "- Check network connection\n",
    "- Restart and try again with shorter segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Out of Memory\"\n",
    "- Reduce video clip duration (try 60-90 seconds)\n",
    "- Decrease segment duration (try 15-20 seconds)\n",
    "- Use Colab Pro for more RAM (25GB vs 12GB)\n",
    "- Close other browser tabs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording Seems Stuck\n",
    "- Check \"Recording: segment_XXX.mp4\" line - file size should grow\n",
    "- If size is increasing, recording is working (be patient)\n",
    "- First cycle takes longer (needs to accumulate initial segments)\n",
    "- Use shorter segment duration for faster cycles\n",
