The stream features a VTuber discussing a recipe called "Mogumogu Vegetable," specifically focusing on eggplant wrapped in pork belly, grilled with ponzu soy sauce. The ingredients listed include eggplant, 150g of thinly sliced pork belly, 2 tablespoons of ponzu, 1 tablespoon of mirin, and appropriate amounts of flour and oil. The cooking instructions explain to slice the eggplant into 1cm pieces and soak them in water, lightly season the pork belly, then lightly flour the eggplant. Next, the eggplant is browned on both sides in a pan with oil, and once cooked, ponzu and mirin are added and simmered, with optional toppings added at the end. The VTuber shares a tip about using black sesame to achieve a deeper purple color, a technique she often employs for decorative sushi rolls. She comments that while it's possible to get a deeper purple, achieving a blue color would be challenging without food coloring, and playfully suggests that making a "Tora-like Taon-san" would be the most difficult.
