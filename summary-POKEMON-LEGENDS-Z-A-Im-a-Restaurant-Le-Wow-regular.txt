The player character battles a Gastly with their Pokemon, Bois, who gets paralyzed, and then Fletchling, who becomes confused but successfully defeats the Gastly. After gathering some items in a cemetery-like area, the player character heads to Rouge Street and speaks with an NPC named Moire. Moire is overjoyed that the player found her Cherished Ring, which she discovered a Sableye was carrying. She expresses surprise at the wild Pokemon's good taste in jewelry and mentions it's her wedding ring given by her husband. As a reward for the player's troubles, Moire gives them money and items, completing the "Sableye in the Cemetery" side mission.

The player character reported back to the Looker Bureau as instructed, after handling every side mission for Emma, which the streamer found amazing. Inside, Emma thanked the player for their help, and Urbain expressed confidence in the player's ability to handle cases, revealing he was looking for someone and had asked Emma for assistance. Emma then began to explain that some Pokémon can evolve to become stronger, and in Lumiose City, there's an Evolution that transcends all others called Mega Evolution. She suggested it would be faster if the player saw it for themselves and asked them to come join her outside, to which Urbain agreed they should follow Emma out. The player character then exited the Looker Bureau, briefly ran around outside, then re-entered the Bureau to look at a picture of Mimi, Emma's partner, which the streamer thought was very cute.

The stream opens with the character investigating an office. They look at two pictures on the wall; one shows Mimi with a man in distinctive goggles looking happy, and the other shows Mimi with a man in a suit, also appearing to have fun. The character then interacts with Mimi, who responds with a "Mrawp" sound. After checking a very clean sink, which seems rarely used, and some case files on a desk belonging to Emma, the character leaves the office. Outside in the Rouge District, the character spots a Pokémon that the streamer immediately questions, asking if its pre-evolution is called Scraggy. After some discussion and confirmation from the chat, the streamer is relieved that she was correct. The character then approaches Emma, who challenges them to a battle. Before engaging, the character heads to the Pokémon Center to heal their team, then returns to the Looker Bureau.

The player character begins at the Locker Bureau on the map and then moves to a park area. There, they talk to Emma, who challenges them to a Pokémon battle. Emma says she wants to see their true strength to teach them about Mega Evolution. Emma sends out her Mareep, and the player sends out their Fletchling. Mareep uses Thunder Wave, paralyzing Fletchling, then attacks with Thunder Shock. The player switches to Bois, who uses Rock Smash and Pin Missile, defeating Emma's Mareep. After winning the battle, Emma praises the player for being a strong trainer and offers to heal their Pokémon.

Emma began by explaining the Mareep evolution line, from Mareep to Flaaffy, and then to Ampharos. She then called out her Ampharos, which appeared, prompting the streamer to exclaim how beautiful and fabulous it was. Emma explained that with a Key Stone and Ampharos's Mega Stone, they could Mega Evolve, announcing "It's Mega Evolution time!" The Mega Evolution animation played, transforming Ampharos into its Mega form. The streamer excitedly commented on how cute and stunning Mega Ampharos was, noting its "fabulous hair" and that it becomes a dragon type. Emma continued, detailing that Mega Evolution surpasses normal limits, making a Pokémon's moves more powerful, but it cannot be sustained forever. Urbain then expressed his desire to become the strongest Mega Evolution user. Finally, Emma gave the player a new mission, asking for help finding a "black, four-legged Pokémon" around the city, and a main mission completion screen popped up, followed by a promotion match announcement.
