The player character walks along a street where a character named Eman is present. Eman explains that small, blue, dumbbell-shaped creatures called "Dumbbells" are swarming a Holopeter machine, making it unusable even after recent maintenance. The player is given a side mission to drive away these four Dumbbells. Upon accepting the mission, the player engages in battle, sending out a red bird-like Pokémon named Tareashi. Tareashi successfully defeats the Dumbbells with a powerful attack. Eman expresses gratitude to the player for clearing the area. However, his relief is short-lived as the Dumbbells suddenly reappear, causing Eman to become disheartened and wonder why they keep coming back to him.
